A sort visualization made using p5 js and clmtrackr js library
3 types of sort(bubble, selection and insertion) can be performed by the shySort object
Visualization uses a y centered bargraph with random +ve and -ve y values in the array
Using the clmtrackr library the program tracks a face on the screen and only continues to sort the array if the prediction score is less than 0.5
I'm probably going to add more sorting algorithms to the object in future for even cooler looking sort visualizations
